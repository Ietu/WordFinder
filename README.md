# WordFinder
English word finder, finds all possible VALID words WITH DEFINITIONS made up of the letters you input. Prints all the words and the words are sorted by length and then alphabetically. 

Can search for single number length words, use a range e.g. 4-6 or leave empty to show all lengths.

Can select if you want definitions printed after every word. NOTE! Very slow with definitions if output > ~250 words.

Input characters like: abcdeopx

TODO: Multiprocessing for over 300 words.
