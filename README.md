# WordFinder
English word finder, finds all possible VALID words WITH DEFINITIONS made up of the letters you input. Prints all the words and the words are sorted by length and then alphabetically. 

Can search for single number length words, use a range e.g. 4-6 or leave empty to show all lengths.

Currently a bit slow when output is more than 300 words because of fetching the definitions.

TODO: Multiprocessing for over 300 words.
